\title{Estimate topic effects}
\usage{
\method{est}{topics}(topics, metadata, formula, refs, nsims = 100,
  ui_level = 0.8, npoints = 100, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{topics}{STM object containing the topic information}

\item{metadata}{Dataframe or matrix of metadata. If the STM was fit with covariate information, this must point to the same metadata used in the STM.}

\item{nsims}{(optional) Number of simulations to perform for inferring covariate effects.}

\item{ui_level}{With of uncertainty interval to report effects. Defaults to .95.}

\item{covariate}{String corresponding to the name of the covariate of interest found in metadata.}
}
\value{
A list containing

\item{est}{The estimate of the effect}
\item{rank}{The rank of the topics based on the effect estimate (increasing)}
\item{sig}{A vector of topic indexes for topics whose uncertainty intervals did not enclose 0.}
}
\description{
Given a covariate of interest, measure its relationship with the samples over topics distribution estimated by the STM.
