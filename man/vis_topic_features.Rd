\description{
Launch an interactive graphical interface to visualize topic model output for
taxonimic abundance data. The interphase integrates STM output with LDAvis
inpired ordination and frequency figures, as well a networkD3 diagram to
display topic correlations.

\details{
This function integrates the samples over topics (theta) and topics
  over taxa distributions (beta) from the STM, the topic correlations from
  the theta component, the covariate effects from the theta component, and
  their relationship with the raw taxonomic abundances. The covariate effects
  for each topic are shown as a scatterplot with error bars corresponding the
  global approximation of uncertainty. If the covariate chosen is binary,
  this reflects their mean difference. For continuous covariates, the points
  represent the mean regression weights (i.e., the estimated slope of the
  covariate). Colors indicate whether a given point's uncertainty interval
  did not enclose 0, where the interval is set by the user.

  The ordination figure maintains the color coding just decribed. The
  ordination is performed on beta via either PCoA (using either
  Jensen-Shannon, Euclidean, Hellinger, Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, or Chi-squared
  distance) or t-SNE. The latter iterates through decreasing perplexity
  values (starting at 30) until the algorithm succeeds. Either the top 2 or 3
  axes can be shown. The radius of the topic points corresponds to the topic
  frequencies marginalized over taxa.

  The bar plot behaves in accordance with LDAvis. When no topics are chosen,
  the overall taxa frequencies across topics are shown. These frequencies do
  not equal the abundances found in the initial abundance table. Instead,
  they show the marginal topic distribution multiplied by beta. These two
  distributions are compared via Kullback-Liebler divergence and then
  weighted by the overall frequency of a given taxa, which determins the
  order in which the taxa are shown. The coloration of the bars indiciates
  the taxonomic group the inidividual taxa belong to. The groups shown are
  determined based on how abundant that group was in the raw abundance table.
  When a topic is selected, the relative frequency of a given taxa in that
  topic is shown in red.

  Lambda controls relevance of taxa within a topic
