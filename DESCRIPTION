Description: A library for performing topic modeling and functional prediction for 16S
  rRNA surveys. You provide an abundance table, sample metadata, and taxonomy
  information, and themetagenomics infers associations between topics and sample
  features, as well as topics and predicted functional content. Functional prediction
  can be accomplished via Tax4Fun (for Silva references) and PICRUSt (for GreenGeenes
  references).
